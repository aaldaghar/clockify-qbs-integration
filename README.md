# Clockify and Quickbooks Online Inregration
This repo is created to document an integration between [QBO](https://quickbooks.intuit.com) and [Clockify] (https://clockify.me/) using [QBO python SDK](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/sdks-and-samples-collections/python) and [Clockify REST API](https://docs.developer.clockify.me/). As a self-employed, I would like to use **Clockify** to track my projects' time, and **QBO** to track expenses, accounting and invoices. 
Below are integrations I am working on:
- Query billable hours and projects from Clockify via GET, use them to POST invoices in QB (In-progress).
## OAuth2.0 qbs and authentication access code
To setup your OAuth2.0 w/ QBO client use the following [guide](https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0).
